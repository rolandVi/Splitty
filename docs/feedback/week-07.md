## Week 7

#### Meeting Organization _(Pass)_

Chairman: Tymoteusz 
Note Taker: Viktor

I would like to kindly remind you that each of you needs to be chairman once and note taker once throughout the project.
Try to be mindful of this when you choose your next chairmen/note takers.

#### Agenda _(Good)_

The agenda was uploaded on time and it followed the template. 

I noticed that you showed me a demo, however there was no point in the agenda that explicitly stated this (perhaps you 
meant to express this in the "what has everyone done?" point, however I would suggest adding an agenda point explicitly 
for the demo).

You also added a point for the planning for next week, however in the meeting you decided to plan the details at a later time.
Moreover, you had a point for the Who, What, When, which you did not quite detail as you decided to discuss this more at length 
at a later time. I would suggest that you look over the agenda more carefully before our meeting and decide more precisely 
what you will be talking about during the meeting.

#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker _(Good)_

The meeting notes were integrated into the agenda and they related to each talking point. The notes were clear as well as
comprehensive. 

However there are no notes for the summarization of the action points (who, what, when). This part can 
correspond to the sprint planning, which you should have for each sprint in your repository by the end of the project. I
would suggest that you think about your task planning for last week and add that to the agenda for week 6.

#### Chair performance _(Very Good)_

Tymoteusz took charge of the meeting. He also checked that all of his teammates agreed with what was discussed before moving 
on to a new point in the agenda, so in that respect you did well.

Perhaps you may have understated how long the announcements by the team would take. However, if you feel that you had a 
constructive discussion on this point, then that should be fine, especially since the meeting ended on time.

#### Attitude & Relation _(Good)_

You communicated openly about any issues you encountered in your last sprint. Moreover, I noticed that most of you were
involved in the conversation, especially when discussing what went wrong last week and discussing your implementation.

However, when Henno showed his issue from last sprint, Leonardo, who was online, could not see the screen and thus he may 
have found it difficult to be involved in the conversation. Next time you have a teammate online, make sure they are 
involved in the conversation at all times such that their input is taken into account throughout the meeting.

Also, when you encountered a disagreement on your implementation, it felt that some teammates were more vocal on the matter
than others. When discussing an important aspect of your implementation, I would suggest that everyone chimes in the
conversation, as some decisions need to be made by the team in unison.

#### Potentially Shippable Product _(Very Good)_

I noticed improvement in your demo as opposed to last week, especially the functionality to add new expenses. You also
discussed your implementation at length during the meeting, which shows that you give your solution quite some thought.
Moreover, you mentioned that you want to finish the basic requirements by the end of this week, which I believe is a 
nice goal.

I will be providing more feedback on how far along you are in the project via the feedback on the Implemented Features 
assignment.

#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team _(Excellent)_
 
I am glad you took my advice to tell me what each of you did last week! This can help you devise a sprint retrospect as 
mentioned last week.

To me, it seems that everyone is making a meaningful contribution to the application. Keep going!
