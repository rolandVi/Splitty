## Week 4

#### Meeting Organization _(Pass)_

Chairman: Leonardo

Note taker: You Xing

#### Agenda _(Very Good)_

The agenda was uploaded on time and it follows the template. I appreciate you adding your questions for me in the agenda, keep this up!

Perhaps the meeting ended a bit early this time but I wouldn't consider it a big problem per se, especially since you used 
your time wisely and made meaningful conversation.

#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker _(Very Good)_

I notice that all of your notes for week 3 relate to the agenda points, they are also clear and concise. You also seem to
have acted on most action points in the task planning throughout the week.

One tip from me would be to try and make your notes a bit more detailed next time. Also, be mindful of how your markdown 
code is displayed (your bullet lists do not show as such in the preview).

#### Chair performance _(Excellent)_

Leonardo took charge of the meeting and went through all talking points. 
He involved his teammates in the conversation and led the task planning part of the meeting. 
He also prompted minute taker to summarize the action points for next week, overall you did a great job!

#### Attitude & Relation _(Good)_

I am happy to have noticed you give each other constructive feedback on your tasks! 
At first, not everyone chimed in, but then you started to speak up when discussing your implementation.

On the other hand, I wish Roland had been more active. I understand that as he was online he missed parts of the conversation, 
however he should have been granted the means to communicate. Next time a teammate is online, try to ensure that they can 
hear everything that is discussed and weigh in. Remember that you should all be active in the TA meetings and take part in 
the discussion.

#### Potentially Shippable Product _(Very Good)_

I enjoyed seeing your demo! You already implemented some of the basic features and seem to be on track to finish the basic
requirements on time, keep up this pace! Also, keep balancing work on the frontend with work on the backend.

#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team _(Excellent)_

You seem to be splitting your tasks more or less equally, as everybody worked on relevant functionality this week. Keep this up!

Keep in mind that you all need to be working on the frontend, as well as the backend of the application. 
I noticed you suggesting that you do not split your work in the frontend and the backend, but rather by the features to 
be implemented from the ground up. This could ensure that you reach your goal of working on all aspects of the application.

Moreover, in case you assign a teammate to work only on the frontend/FXML scenes in one week, try to ensure that they have enough 
lines of code to pass the knockout criteria for the week.
