## Week 6

#### Meeting Organization _(Pass)_

Chair: Viktor
Note taker: Leonardo

#### Agenda _(Very Good)_

The agenda was uploaded on time and it followed the template. The talking points seemed feasible for a 45-minute meeting,
but perhaps you may have overstated the time each point took as the meeting ended a little early. However, as long as you discussed
everything on your agenda, that should be fine.

#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker _(Very Good)_

I looked over your notes for week 4, and each agenda point was elaborated on. I also noticed that you added the planning
for that sprint, which is great. However, it would have been better had you added who had been assigned to the tasks that
you devised. 

Take a look at the Tasks and Planning Assignment and at the Project Management slides. Each sprint should include a 
planning, a review and a retrospect, which you can add to your agenda/meeting notes. The planning can correspond to that 
"who, what, when?" point in the agenda. The sprint review implies you looking back on the previous sprint and assessing 
whether everyone did their task (the demo can also be considered the sprint review). In the retrospect you mention what 
went well/wrong in the past sprint.

#### Chair performance _(Excellent)_

Viktor took charge of the meeting and went through all agenda points. He involved his teammates in the conversation, 
especially when devising the planning for the week. He also showed me the team demo, so well done!

The meeting ended 7 minutes early, but if you discussed everything that you needed to discuss then that should be fine. 

#### Attitude & Relation _(Excellent)_

Most teammates were involved in the discussion, especially when planning on the code. The conversation was constructive and
led to decisions related to the planning for the week, including the planning of meetings. You communicated openly if you 
had any issues that would impede you from participating in a meeting. You were also very proactive especially in asking me 
questions, so nicely done!

#### Potentially Shippable Product _(Very Good)_

The application was functional and I noticed improvement on it compared to the last sprint. I would say that you are on 
track to finish the basic requirements by the end of the project.

Take a look at the HCI and Testing assignments, there is a deadline for them by the end of this week.

#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team _(Sufficient)_

Most of you contributed equally to the conversation this meeting, however I was not quite able to gauge how you distribute 
your work per se. Perhaps next week you could do a round in which each teammate tells me what they did. This could also help
you with the sprint rview as mentioned above.
