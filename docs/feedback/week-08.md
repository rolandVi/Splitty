## Week 7

#### Meeting Organization _(Pass)_

Chairman: Henno

Note Taker: You Xing

#### Agenda _(Good)_

The agenda was uploaded on time and it followed the template.

It seems that you do not have an agenda point specifically for the demo. Next time, try to specify in the agenda that you 
will show me a demo of the application. 

Moreover, this is a small nit, but you had a few headers at the end of your agenda, I would personally remove them. 

#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker _(Sufficient)_

The meeting notes for last week were rather succinct, and it was a bit unclear whether they related to all agenda points.
Moreover, they are not quite concrete (eg. how do you plan to "finish basic requirements"? A course staff member reading
the notes may not understand much of what you wrote down for the talking points). 

I would suggest firstly relating all meeting notes to the agenda points (you can do this by adding the notes below each 
agenda point), and secondly noting down the more concrete decisions that you make within your team (i.e. a sprint plan/sprint
retrospect).

#### Chair performance _(Excellent)_

Henno took charge of the meeting and went through all agenda points. He also involved his teammates in the conversation, 
and prompted the minute taker to recount what was discussed during the meeting. Moreover, he used up the remaining time
in the meeting to plan issues for next week, so well done!

#### Attitude & Relation _(Very Good)_

Most of you got involved in the conversation especially when asking me questions. You had meaningful and constructive 
discussions on your implementation, so well done!

However, I did not notice all teammates being equally involved in the conversation. I would suggest that everyone chimes in 
the discussion such that all points of view are taken into account when devising the final implementation.

#### Potentially Shippable Product _(Good)_

From your demo, it seems that you can finish the basic requirements by the end of the project.

Make sure that, when you show me the demo, the functionality that you show me is merged on the main branch, as according 
to the rubric your version should be "potentially shippable".

For the JSON dump requirement, the backlog states that the user can download it. I would thus suggest that you implement
the functionality of downloading a file to your computer with the JSON data, not just copying it. Moreover, try to ensure
that your UI is responsive to the JSON dump. I clicked the corresponding button when grading your features but did not know 
that it would copy the JSON to the clipboard.

Moreover, remember to implement long polling, as this is important for passing the final Technology rubric on the Communication 
point.

#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team _(Very Good)_

From your conversations it seems that you are all making meaningful contributions to the final implementation. Keep going!

Remember that for the final presentation all 6 teammates must present equally. I noticed Henno suggesting that someone speaks
for the most part, however I would recommend against it. Please refer to the Product Pitch rubric again.
