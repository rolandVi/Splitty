## Week 2

#### Meeting Organization _(Pass)_

Chairman: Roland

Minute taker: Henno

#### Agenda _(Very good)_

The agenda was uploaded on time and it followed the template. The discussion points were also feasible for a 45-minute meeting, so well done!

I noticed you had a point in your agenda on discussing checkstyle rules (with an allotted 10 minutes), but the point was very briefly discussed. It's easy to overestimate how long an agenda point would take. However, try to think for each talking point if you need/want to discuss this during the TA meeting, or at another time.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker _(N/A)_

Since you did not have a minute taker last week, this rubric is not applicable now. I will start looking over your meeting notes and giving you feedback on them starting next week.

#### Chair performance _(Good)_

Roland went through all the agenda points during the meeting such that the team finished on time.

I noticed that at times during the meeting you let other teammates take over and lead the discussion. Try to be a little more proactive as a chairman and take charge of the meeting more.

#### Attitude & Relation _(Excellent)_

The team took ownership of the meeting. It was nice to see everyone being involved in the conversation and making plans, so props to you for being proactive! I was also pleased to notice you giving each other advice and helping each other out.

#### Potentially Shippable Product _(Very good)_

Since last week, you started working on the Code of Conduct. I liked the points you made on how you want to communicate within the team. I also liked that you appointed a project manager to submit the files on Brightspace.

Try to start coding this week as well. From now on, your code contributions to the repository will be monitored throughout the project. You can find more information on what is expected of you on a weekly basis in the studyguide.

#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team _(Excellent)_

You mentioned that all team members contributed to the Code of Conduct, and also that you would start organizing issues and milestones on GitLab.

One tip from me would be that, when you split your work on the code, try to do it such that everyone has issues to complete and that the issues are comparable in difficulty.
