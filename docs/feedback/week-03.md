## Week 3

#### Meeting Organization _(Pass)_

Chairman: You Xing

Note Taker: Roland

#### Agenda _(Excellent)_

The agenda was uploaded on time. It follows the template and the proposed discussion points were feasible for a 45-minute meeting.

You mentioned that you underestimated how long the discussion on the Code of Conduct would take, but to me it seemed fine, especially since you ended on time. However, perhaps you could have focused a bit more on discussing matters related to code.

#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker _(Excellent)_

The notes touched on each topic that had been introduced in the agenda, and they were clear as well as concise. They included the action points for the following week, which were concrete and realistic.

I noticed you added a point proposing to be "precise in the to-do list for the project". That still seems a bit vague to me, how will you achieve that?

Also, one tip from me would be to insert the meeting notes into the agenda directly (not after it). This is just something that I would personally do.

#### Chair performance _(Very good)_

You Xing took charge of the meeting and ensured that everyone was involved in the conversation. He wrapped up the talking points that took too much time. He also checked in with the note taker at the end of the meeting and asked for feedback, so great job!

One small tip from me is to be even more assertive when wrapping up the talking points. If you feel that there is no more time to discuss one point, it is fine to propose that you talk about it more at length after the meeting.

#### Attitude & Relation _(Very good)_

Overall most team members were active and provided meaningful feedback, especially towards the end of the meeting. I was pleased to notice you explain project-related concepts to each other.

I noticed a couple of moments in the beginning of the meeting when it was unclear who had worked on certain tasks. One tip from me would be to try to be a bit more up to date with what everybody is/has been working on throughout the project.

#### Potentially Shippable Product _(Very good)_

I was pleased to notice your progress in terms of the code! Your Code of Conduct seems to be almost finished as well. Overall it seems that you have made good progress last week, so keep going!

#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team _(Excellent)_

I noticed that each of you had worked on the code base, as well as the Code of Conduct. Your distribution of work seems to be more or less equal, I think it was a good idea to have each of your working on a class. Well done!
