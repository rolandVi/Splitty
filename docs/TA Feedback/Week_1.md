## TA Feedback - Week 1

#### 1) Self-organization _(Good)_

It was nice to see questions coming in from multiple team members and to also notice you warm up to each other over the course of the meeting. It was also nice to notice small pieces of advice being shared from teammates with prior experience. Overall most of you spoke up and the tone of the conversation was respectful.

Do keep in mind that from next week on you will be organizing these meetings yourselves, and I will only be observing. You will thus have to be a bit more proactive in choosing the subject of conversation.


#### 2) Suggested Topics _(Good)_

In the meeting we discussed the course schedule and what you can expect from the OOP Project. You showed initiative when you started organizing yourselves (in terms of communication channels, chairman & note taker assignment). 

Try to maintain communication by the next meeting, maybe start thinking about what rules to put down in the code of conduct. You can find a template for it (and also for the agendas) in the Teamwork assignment on Brightspace.
