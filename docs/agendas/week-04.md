FXML controller do not need to be tested
Refer to the rubric posted on BrightSpace on what should be tested
  - What are the formative deadlines of this week? Are we getting feedback soon? (2 min)

  - What should we use as the preferred API for dependency injection? (2 min)
We can use any api we want, however we need to be able to justify our choice of API
  - What should we do with stages ? (2 min)
Three suggestions have been made:
1. Create new stages/window when for example creating a new event. This would however clutter the screen and is not nice.
2. Create new a new stage (like create new event) and delete them after completed (like after hitting create)
3. Create new a new stage and delete the previous stage.
- Present current working demo of the project (5 min)
The current stage is pretty nice.
Our pace is good.
