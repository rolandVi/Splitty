# Notes week 3

TA announcements:
-If someone failed the GIT assignment, they need to redo it 
    -Read the assignment carefully, check what the repository graph is supposed to look like

Talking points:
Code of Conduct:
    - Everyone finished their part in the CoC
    - Ensure that each point in the CoC is accompanied by an explanation of how to achieve it within our team

Issue board:
    - Issue boards are containers to differentiate issues
    - We decided to use them instead of the to-do, in-progress and done tags

Decide next week's issues & Planing for the coming week:
    - Planing and issues for the coming week were done after the meeting
        - Creation of scenes (Start page, Home page, Admin login page, Admin overview page)
        - Password generation for Admin log-in
        - Server side CRUD operation for events
    - Check GitLab for closer information

Notes to issues:
    - An issue should conclude which user-stories it touches up on
    - Multiple issues can be closed by one merge request
